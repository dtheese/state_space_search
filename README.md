# state_space_search
Generic state space search library with toy eight puzzle example

This repository contains the C++ source code to accompany this magazine article:
https://www.drdobbs.com/state-space-searching/184401857

In case this link ever breaks, the article is also included in this repository. See **C10theese.pdf**.

Given that this article dates back to 2004, the version of C++ used was C++98.

I have not investigated if this code could benefit from any of the features of C++11/14/17/20. Any thoughts on this matter are welcome, or fork and improve!
